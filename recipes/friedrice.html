        <h2>What you need:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tbsp neutral oil</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                <li><sub>1/2</sub> medium white onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and diced</li>
                <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
                <li>1 tbsp fresh ginger, chopped</li>
                <li>4 scallions, chopped, dark green tops reserved for garnish</li>
                <li>4 cups cooked and chilled white rice</li>
                <li>3 tbsp soy sauce or tamari</li>
                <li>1<sub>1/2</sub> tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
                <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Step by step:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat ½ teaspoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the eggs and cook, stirring often, for about 1 minute to scramble. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
                <li>Wipe out the pan and return it to medium heat. Heat another 1 tablespoon of the oil, then add the onion, carrots, and peas. Cook, stirring often, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until softened.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan along with the garlic, ginger, and white and light green parts of the scallions. Stir, then add the rice, soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil. Stir to coat the rice, then press it evenly into the bottom of the pan. Cook, stirring only occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, allowing the rice to become lightly crisp and browned from sustained contact with the pan.</li>
                <li>Stir in the remaining ½ tablespoon sesame oil, the rice vinegar, and the scrambled eggs. Season to taste, garnish with the reserved scallion tops, and serve.</li>
